# ðŸ”¢ Digit Detection and Recognition API

A FastAPI-based service that detects and recognizes handwritten digits from an uploaded image. The system processes the image, segments each digit, and classifies it using multiple trained models (Simple Neural Network, CNN, SVM, Linear Classifier). The output includes bounding boxes, predictions, and model confidence for each digit.
